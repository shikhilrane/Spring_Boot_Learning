Entity Relationship :
    1. In Spring Boot (with JPA/Hibernate), entity relationship means how your database tables are connected and how you represent those connections using annotations in your Java entity classes.
    2. Main types of relationships:
        1. One-to-One = one table connected to one table
        2. One-to-Many = one table connected to many table
        3. Many-to-One = many table connected to one table
        4. Many-to-Many = many table connected to many table

    Understanding of these mappings :
        We can understand their relationship by ER Diagram (i.e. Entity Relationship Diagram)
        Symbols :
            1. O  → Partial participation (optional)
            2. |  → Full participation (mandatory)
            3. <  → Many
            Refer Diagram for more understanding

            Example :
                1. One-to-One : ||  to  O|  ,   One side mandatory other side optional
                2. One-to-Many : ||  to  O<   ,     One side mandatory, many side optional
                3. Many-to-One : O<  to  ||     ,     Many side optional, one side mandatory
                4. Many-to-Many : O<  to  O<    ,   Both sides optional (logically), implemented using a join table

        A table who have Foreign key will own the relationship means it wil decide how inverse side relationship should be added in table and the other side is inverse side (FK means inverse side is added in this table)


    Code Example :
        1. One-to-One : one can have only one of other table ('One Patient' can have only 'One Insurance')
            in Patient,
                @OneToOne
                @JoinColumn(name = "patient_insurance_id", unique = true)   // Can be used only at owning side (use to rename the name of to mapping in DB table)
                private Insurance insurance;    // Owning Side (Means Patient can't exist without Insurance) (this will work as Foreign Key in Patient table so it is a Owning side)
            in Insurance,
                @OneToOne(mappedBy = "insurance") // As we have used mappedBy here, so in DB, insurance doesn't have column patient_id
                private Patient patient;    // Inverse side (Means Insurance can exist without Patient) (Optional to add this)

            If a Foreign Key (FK) with name of another table, is present in table then that table is owning side means that table can't exist without another table

            Description of Majors :
                @OneToOne : Use to indicate relationship
                @JoinColumn name : Use strictly at owning side. It is used to rename the name of to mapping in DB table
                @JoinColumn unique = true : One patient can only have one insurance
                mappedBy = "insurance" : It is inverse side and in DB, insurance doesn't have column patient_id

        2. Many-to-One : Many can have One of other table ('Many Appointment' can be booked by 'One Patient')
            in Appointment,
                @ManyToOne
                @JoinColumn(nullable = false)   // Owning side
                private Patient patient;
            in Patient,
                // One-To-Many with Appointment
                @OneToMany(mappedBy = "patient") // Inverse Side
                private List<Appointment> appointments = new ArrayList<>(); // Numbers of appointments will be stored here

        3. Many-to-One : Many can have One of other table ('Many Appointment' can be booked by 'One Doctor')
            in Appointment,
                @ManyToOne
                @JoinColumn(nullable = false)   // Owning side
                private Doctor doctor;
            in Doctor,
                @OneToMany(mappedBy = "doctor")
                private List<Appointment> appointments = new ArrayList<>();

        4. One-to-One : 'One Department' can have 'One headDoctor' (Each Department can have one headDoctor)
            in Department,
                @OneToOne
                @JoinColumn(nullable = false)   // FK
                private Doctor headDoctor; // Owning Side
            in Doctor
                @OneToOne(mappedBy = "headDoctor")
                private Department department;

        5. Many-to-Many : 'Many Department' can have 'Many Doctors' (Each dept can have multiple other doctors & also one doctor can work in multiple department)
            in Department,
                @ManyToMany
                private List<Doctor> doctors = new ArrayList<>();
            in Doctor,
                @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "doctors")
                private List<Department> departments = new ArrayList<>();
            NOTE : When we create Many-to-Many relationship, hibernate will create a joint table for it
                   Joint-table will have only 2 columns like department_id and doctors_id


    NOTES :
        1. Relationship with FK is owning side and It has full participation (i.e. it is 'from Side')
            But If in FK table @JoinColumn(nullable = true) then it becomes partial participation because it can be null i.e. can be process further without 'to Side'.
        2. The side where is 0 in ER Diagram, means the other table can have value as 0 for the table.
