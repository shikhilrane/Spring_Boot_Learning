Annotations :
    1. @Configuration -> It is a Spring annotation that marks a class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.
                         (Source of Beans, and Bean Data from this class to be injected in properties of bean class is called bean class)
    2. @Bean -> @Bean is a Spring annotation used to declare a method that returns a Spring-managed bean to be registered in the application context.
                (Bean methods hold data that to be injected in Bean class's properties)
                (Bean methods are created in @Configuration class)
                PACKAGE - config
    3. @Component -> @Component marks a class as a Spring-managed bean for automatic detection and registration.
                     (When we use, Annotation based XML configuration, We use @Component Annotation directly in bean class)
                     PACKAGE - beans
    4. @Value -> @Value annotation injects literal values or expressions into Spring bean fields or method parameters.
                 (When we use, Annotation based XML configuration and @Component annotation, then we use this annotation to enter value in bean class directly)
                 PACKAGE - beans
    5. @ComponentScan() -> @ComponentScan tells Spring where to look for classes annotated with @Component, @Service, @Repository, or @Controller to register them as beans.
                         (From config class, we tell Spring that for the data go given package for the further operation)
                         PACKAGE - config
    6. @Autowired - It is a Annotation in Spring used for automatic DI. It tells Spring that, get bean object of Autowired class and inject in this class.
                    Autowiring can be achieved only on non-primitive data types or user defined data types (excluding String), not on primitive data types.
                    Directly used in bean class so that Spring will search for
    7. @Qualifier("method_name") - This annotation in Spring helps pick the right bean among multiple beans of same type. Use to resolve Ambiguity.
