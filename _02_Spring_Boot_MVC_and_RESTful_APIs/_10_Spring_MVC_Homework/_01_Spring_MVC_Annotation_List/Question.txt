Q. Make a list of all the annotations we have seen so far in the Spring Web Framework.

1. Main File -> 

@SpringBootApplication - A single annotation that starts a Spring Boot app by enabling auto-configuration, component scanning, and basic setup automatically.


2. Controller Package ->

@RestController - Marks a class as a REST API controller that directly returns data (like JSON) instead of web pages.

@RequestMapping - Maps an HTTP request URL and method (GET, POST, etc.) to a specific controller method that should handle it.

@GetMapping - Maps an HTTP GET request to a controller method to fetch data from the server.

@PostMapping - Maps an HTTP POST request to a controller method to send data to the server and create something new.

@PutMapping - Maps an HTTP PUT request to a controller method to update existing data on the server.

@DeleteMapping - Maps an HTTP DELETE request to a controller method to remove data from the server.

@PatchMapping - Maps an HTTP PATCH request to a controller method to partially update existing data on the server.


3. Advices Packages -> 

* GlobalExceptionHandler -
	@RestControllerAdvice - Handles exceptions and common responses for all REST controllers globally in one central place.

	@ExceptionHandler - Catches and handles specific exceptions in a controller (or globally) so you can return a clean, custom error response instead of a crash.

* ApiError - 
	@Data - Automatically generates getters, setters, toString(), equals(), and hashCode() methods for a class, reducing boilerplate code.

	@Builder - Provides an easy, readable way to create objects step by step without writing complex constructors.

* GlobalResponseHandler -
	@RestControllerAdvice - Handles exceptions and common responses for all REST controllers globally in one central place.

* APIResponse
	@Data - Automatically generates getters, setters, toString(), equals(), and hashCode() methods for a class, reducing boilerplate code.
	@JsonFormat - Controls how a field (like date or time) is formatted when converting between Java objects and JSON.


4. DTO Package ->
Lombok

	@Getter:
	Automatically creates getter methods for all variables in the class.

	@Setter:
	Automatically creates setter methods for all variables in the class.

	@AllArgsConstructor:
	Automatically creates a constructor with parameters for all class variables.

	@NoArgsConstructor:
	Automatically creates a constructor with no parameters.

Validation annotations for applying custom validation annotation


5. Services Package -> 

@Service - Marks a class as a service layer where business logic is written and managed by Spring automatically.


6. config Package ->

@Configuration - Marks a class as a configuration file that defines and sets up Spring beans for the application.

@Bean - Tells Spring to create, manage, and reuse an object returned by a method as a shared application component.


7. entities Package -> 

Lombok
	@Entity:
	Tells Spring/JPA that this class represents a database table.

	@Getter:
	Automatically creates getter methods for all variables in the class.

	@Setter:
	Automatically creates setter methods for all variables in the class.

	@AllArgsConstructor:
	Automatically creates a constructor with parameters for all class variables.

	@NoArgsConstructor:
	Automatically creates a constructor with no parameters.

	@Table:
	Specifies the exact database table name and settings for this entity.

@Id - Marks a field as the unique identifier (primary key) for a database record.

@GeneratedValue - Tells the database to automatically generate the value for the primary key.

@JsonProperty - Controls the name or behavior of a field when converting Java objects to/from JSON.


8. Repositories -> 

@Repository - Marks a class as a data access layer that talks to the database and handles data storage and retrieval.
