Service layer ->
    It is used to communicate between controller(Presentation to handle user interaction) and repository (Persistence which is responsible for data access) layer
    It contains business logic of application

1. Copied the project from repository/persistence project
2. Created services package, and created EmployeeService class and instead of giving reference of repository directly in controller we give reference in service layer and wrote login directly in it
3. In Controller, created reference of EmployeeService and made constructor of it.
4. From every method, returned EmployeeDto
5. In EmployeeService, created reference of EmployeeRepository and made constructor of it.
6. Also created MapperConfig class in config folder, created getModelMapper method that return object of ModelMapper class
7. In EmployeeService, created reference of ModelMapper and made constructor of it.
    (ModelMapper -> ModelMapper is a tool that helps automatically copy data from one object to another — like copying info from a form to a database object — so you don’t have to write the copying code yourself.)
    We put ModelMapper in a separate class inside the config folder so it’s set up once and can be used easily anywhere in the app.
