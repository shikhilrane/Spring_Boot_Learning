Bean :
    A "Bean" is managed object that is instantiated, assembled, and managed by the Spring IoC container.
    Beans form the backbone of the Spring Application and are the core building blocks that are wired together to create the application.

Java Bean Class :
    A serializable class with no-arguments constructor, often used to encapsulate data and adhere to JavaBeans conventions for easy integration with frameworks.
    (A JavaBean is a type of POJO that follows specific conventions: it must be serializable, have a no-arg constructor, and use getters/setters for properties.)
    Rules JavaBean Class :
        1. Variables should be private,
        2. it should have public getter/setter to get and set value in properties,
        3. It should have default constructor (no explicitly defined constructor) or no-argument constructor (if defined, then should not insert parameters)

Java Bean Object :
    Object created by Spring Framework using Java BeanClass or POJO class is called Java Bean Object / Spring Bean
    Java Bean Object is instance of Java Bean Class
    It is reusable, encapsulated Java component with properties, getters and setters, designed for easy integration and manipulation

Life-Cycle of Java Bean Object:
    1. Loading Bean Definitions : (Searching for POJO or Bean Class)
        Spring loads definitions from various sources like XML Based configuration, Java Based configuration or by Component Scanning
        These beans definitions contains information about the bean class, dependencies and other configuration details
        e.g. ->
            1.1 Java Config
                    @Configuration
                    @ComponentScan("beans")  // beans package scan karega
                    public class SpringConfig {
                    }
                                OR
            1.2 XML
                    <beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
                           xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context"
                           xsi:schemaLocation="...">

                        <context:component-scan base-package="beans"/>
                    </beans>

    2. Bean Instantiation : (Creating a Bean Object)
        After bean definitions are loaded, the spring container creates instances of beans based on these definitions
        This involves invoking the bean class's constructors, either the default constructors or specified constructor, to create an actual instance of the bean
        The newly created bean instance is now read for configuration and initialization.
        Values will be first as null for string properties and 0 for numeric property
        e.g. ->
            ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(SpringConfig.class);

            Here Constructor is called

            @Component
            public class Student {
                public Student() {
                    System.out.println("Student constructor called");
                }
            }

    3. Bean Initialization : (Values will be injected from POJO class using setters or injections)
        Once the bean is instantiated, Spring proceeds to configure and initialize it
        Property values are set using setter, constructor arguments, or field injection, populating the bean state
        e.g. ->
            @Component
            public class Student {
                private String name;

                public void setName(String name) {
                    this.name = name;
                }

                public void display() {
                    System.out.println("Name is " + name);
                }
            }

            In Spring Config file,

            @Configuration
            public class SpringConfig {
                @Bean
                public Student std() {
                    Student s = new Student();
                    s.setName("Shikhil");  // setter injection
                    return s;
                }
            }

            OR in XML file

            <!-- applicationContext.xml -->
            <bean id="student" class="beans.Student">
                <property name="name" value="Shikhil" />
            </bean>

    4. Use Bean Object :
        using a bean object using context.getBean();
        e.g.
            Student std = (Student) context.getBean("std");
            std.display();  // Output: Name is Shikhil

    5. Bean Object Destruction :
        it will be deleted
        This process will be happen under the hood, but we should know this as well
            @Component
            public class Student implements DisposableBean {
                @Override
                public void destroy() {
                    System.out.println("Bean is being destroyed");
                }
            }

            in MainClass,

            AnnotationConfigApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(SpringConfig.class);
            context.close();  // destroy method call hoga

Spring Annotations :
    1. We mostly use java based configuration to configure our project with the help of some Annotations and not XML file
    2. Annotations carry some metadata inside them so that we don't need to write that metadata everywhere.

Defining Beans :
    1. Using Stereotype Annotations (with CommandLineRunner and .run method of it)
        Annotate your class with one of the stereotype annotations (@Component, @Service, @Repository, @Controller). There annotations inform Spring that the class should be managed as a bean.

    2. Using @Bean Annotation in a Configuration Class (with config file)
        Define beans manually in a Java class marked with @Configuration.
            You create a method that returns the object you want as a bean.
            Annotate that method with @Bean.
            Spring will call that method and register the returned object as a bean.

Scope of the Beans :
    1. Singleton -> (Default) Scopes a single bean definition to a single instance for each Spring IoC container
            "One shared instance for everyone."
                Spring creates just one object of the bean and shares it everywhere in the application.
                Example: Like a printer in an office – everyone uses the same one.
    2. Prototype -> Scopes a single bean definition to any number of object instances
            "New object every time you ask."
                Spring creates a new object every time the bean is requested.
                Example: Like ordering custom coffee – you get a fresh cup every time.
    3. request -> Scopes a single bean definition to lifecycle of single HTTP request. That is each HTTP request has its own instace of bean created off the back of a single bean definition. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext
            "One bean per web request."
                For each HTTP request, Spring gives you a new instance of the bean.
                Valid only in web applications.
                Example: Like a ticket for each person at a cinema – each request gets its own ticket.
    4. websocket -> Scopes a single single bean definition to lifecycle of a websocket. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.
            "One bean per WebSocket connection."
                For each WebSocket connection, Spring creates a new bean instance.
                Again, valid only in web apps that use WebSockets.
                Example: Like having a private chat room – each user connection has its own room.
