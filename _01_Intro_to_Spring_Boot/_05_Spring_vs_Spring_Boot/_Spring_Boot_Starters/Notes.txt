Spring Boot Starters :
    1. Spring Boot starters are "Dependency Descriptors".
        Dependency - External libraries or JARs
        Descriptors - Configurations specifying JARs and their versions.
        So, It basically tells, which JAR files are adding and their versions and which configurations are going to add and which configurations Spring Boot provides automatically
    2. It Combines all the necessary libraries (JAR files) for a particular features or technology into a single Dependency (spring-boot-starter-web).
        If we want to create Spring Boot Web Applications, then in that case i need some JAR files like web.jar, web-mvc.jar, validation.jar, tomcat.jar, loggin.jar, etc. and other basic JAR files like AOP, Spring Core, Spring Context, Spring Expression, etc. then in that case i will only provide single Spring Boot Starter (i.e. dependency) and that Starter will add all these JAR files in our code
    Example :
        <dependencies>
            <dependency>
                <groupId>org.springframework.boot<groupId>          // Identifies the group or organization
                <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web<artifactId>     // The actual library or module
                <version>3.2.0<version>                             // The version of the library
            </dependency>
            ---
        </dependencies>

    NOTE : If you're using Spring Boot's parent POM (i.e. pom.xml), you usually don’t need to specify the version for starters like spring-boot-starter-web because it inherits it automatically.
            <dependencies>
                <dependency>
                    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
                    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
                </dependency>
            </dependencies>

            // We can even add other dependencies as well for DB and Testing
            <dependencies>
                <dependency>
                    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
                    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
                </dependency>
            </dependencies>

            <dependencies>
                <dependency>
                    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
                    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId>
                </dependency>
            </dependencies>

Use of Spring Boot Starter
    1. Simplifies Configuration :
        Starters automatically include the right libraries and setting we need, so that we can write code faster
    2. Boost Productivity :
        Saves time and efforts by providing sensible defaults and configurations, allowing  developers to focus on writing business logic rather than managing dependencies.
    3. Ensure Compatibility :
        Ensure that all included dependencies are compatible with each other and the Spring boot version being used, reducing the risk of conflicts.

Important Spring Boot Starters :
    1. spring-boot-starter
        It is a core starter that includes auto-configuration support, logging, and YAML processing.
    2. spring-boot-starter-web
        It provides dependencies to build web applications, including Spring MVC, RESTful services and embedded Tomcat. Also Logging and Validations
    3. spring-boot-starter-data-jpa
        It provides dependencies for Spring Data JPA, Hibernate and database connection pool.
    4. spring-boot-starter-security
        It includes Spring Security and its dependencies for securing apps.
    5. spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf (Server-side rendering with Thymeleaf)
        It integrates the Thymeleaf templating engine with Spring MVC
    6. spring-boot-starter- test
        It includes testing libraries like JUnit, Hamcrest, and Mockito
    7. spring-boot-starter-actuator
        It provides production ready features to help monitor and manage your applications, including health checks and metrics
    8. spring-boot-starter-aop
        It brings in support for aspect oriented programming using Spring AOP and AspectJ.
