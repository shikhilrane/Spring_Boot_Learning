What is Programming Language ->
    Communication medium between humans and computers
    Provides syntaxes(Rules) and semantics(Format)
    Used to develop software apps, technologies, libraries and even framework
    e.g. C,C++,Java,JS,etc

Libraries ->
    Libraries are collection of packages.
    Every JAR file in Spring and Spring Boot is a library.
    Library makes our code easier to write.
    e.g. mysql-connector-java.jar

Framework ->
    Framework is collection of multiple Libraries
    Framework follows Design Pattern
    e.g. Spring and Spring Boot

Web App Architecture ->
    | User Interface       |           | Web layer      Business Layer   DAO (JDBC)            |           |          |
    | (HTML,CSS,JS,React)  | --------> | (servlet jsp)   (Code logic)     (Code for DB Access) | --------> | Database |
    | Frontend Application |           |              Backend Application                      |           |          |
              1.                                                  2.                                            3.
    Frameworks are for User Interface, Web Layer and Database
        1. User Interface -> React (It is library but when we use this with Next JS then it works as Framework) and Angular
        2. Web Framework -> Obsolete now, and replace by Spring
        3. Database -> ORM Framework like Hibernate
    Spring contains all of these framework, So it is also called as Framework of Frameworks

Spring is Modular framework ->
    1. Spring Core :
