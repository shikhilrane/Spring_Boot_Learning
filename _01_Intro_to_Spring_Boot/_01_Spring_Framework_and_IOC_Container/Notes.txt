Before Spring Framework ->
    01. Before Spring, developers were using Java Enterprise Edition (JavaEE) to build web-services, some batch processing, some authentication system, etc.
    02. But the problem with that was, they had to configure lots of stuff even before writing single piece of business logic.

Introduction to Spring Framework ->
    01. Open source Java Framework.
    02. With the help of Spring, we can develop Standalone application as well as Enterprise applications.
    03. Released in 2003 but it was initial release under Apache 1.0 license.
    04. 1st production release 1.0 was in 2004
    05. Developed by Rod Johnson
    06. Spring is a dependency injection framework to make Java application loosely coupled.
    07. Spring Framework makes the development process easy for JavaEE applications
    08. SWe don't need to take care of dependencies because that will be taken caren by Spring Framework, So we can have Enterprise level support while using Spring Framework

Basic Advantages of Spring ->
    01. Modular and Lightweight = It follows modular architecture thats why modular
    02. Flexible Configuration = Can provide XML, Java-based, Annotation based configuration.
    03. Dependency Injection = One object is injected into another object
    04. Aspect-Oriented Programming(AOP) = Spring support AOP Paradigm
    05. Simplified Database Access  = Can access DB with JDBC easily with Spring, also there is ORM module that support Hibernate and JPA. Spring Reduces boilerplate code
    06. Testing Support = Testing of Spring applications is easy
    07. Security = Spring provides Spring security module, with the help of this module Spring application become more secure
    08. Integration Capabilities = Can be connect with other framework with react, angular, jms, web-services and other third party APIs
    09. Scalability = Spring applications can more scalable
    10. Open Source = Free to use

IOC or SpringContainer ->
    In Spring Framework, the IOC container is responsible for managing the components of an application and injecting dependencies into them. The container creates the objects (beans), wires them and manages their complete lifecycle.
    1. Spring container is a core component of Spring (Heart of Spring Framework)
    2. We can compare it with JVM, like JVM manages Java application same way Spring Container manages Spring Application
    3. Responsibilities -> Use to manage bean objects (Creation, Initialise, and Destroy bean objects)
                        -> Manage Bean Lifecycle
                        -> Dependency Injection
                        -> Spring supports AOP through Spring Container
                        -> Use to manage Transaction Management
                        -> Internationalisation Support (I18N)
                        -> Integration of Framework and DB framework Integration
    4. Types of Spring Container: There are 2 types of Spring Container
                                  1. Bean factory (old)
                                  2. Application Context (new) (It is use to start Spring Application) (Interface)

Working of IOC or Spring Container:
    1. Creating a POJO class or JavaBean class: (Used to represent data using getters and setters, These classes become Spring beans.)
        When we say POJO or JavaBean classes are used "to represent data using getters and setters", it means: These classes store data in private fields and provide public getter and setter methods to access and modify that data. This follows the encapsulation principle of object-oriented programming.
        POJO Class :
            A simple Java class with fields and getters/setters, used for data representation without framework dependencies.
            (A POJO (Plain Old Java Object) is a simple Java class with no special restrictions.)
        JavaBean class :
            A serializable class with no-arguments constructor, often used to encapsulate data and adhere to JavaBeans conventions for easy integration with frameworks.
            (A JavaBean is a type of POJO that follows specific conventions: it must be serializable, have a no-arg constructor, and use getters/setters for properties.)
            Rules JavaBean Class : Variables should be private, it should have public getter/setter to get and set value in properties, It should have default constructor.
        Bean Class ->
            class Student{
                private String name;
                private int rollNo;

                // getter and setters
                public void setName(String name) {
                    this.name = name;
                }
                public String getName() {
                    return name;
                }

                public void setRollNo(int rollNo) {
                    this.rollNo = rollNo;
                }
                public int getRollNo() {
                    return rollNo;
                }
            }

    2. Configuration file: (It will be used for mapping POJO class/JavaBeans class with Spring Container)
        This is where you define how Spring should create and manage beans.
        There are three ways to configure Spring beans: XML file configuration, Java-based Configuration and Annotation-based Configuration
            1. XML file configuration:
                You define beans in an XML file, usually named applicationContext.xml.
                <beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
                       ...>
                    <bean id="student" class="com.example.Student"/>
                </beans>
            2. Java-based Configuration:
                Use @Configuration and @Bean annotations.
                @Configuration
                public class AppConfig {
                    @Bean
                    public Student student() {
                        return new Student();
                    }
                }
            3. Annotation-based Configuration:
                Use annotations like @Component, @Service, and @Autowired.
                @Component
                public class Student {
                    private String name;
                    private int rollNo;
                    // getters and setters
                }

                And in the config class:

                @ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example")
                @Configuration
                    public class AppConfig {
                }

    3. Spring Container: (The Spring Container is the core of the Spring Framework. It is responsible for managing the entire lifecycle of Spring beans(objects in container)).
        What does the Spring Container do?
            1. Reads the configuration (XML, Java-based, or annotations)
            2. Creates objects (beans) from the classes which are POJO/JavaBean classes you configure for Spring to create and manage as beans.
            3. Manages dependencies between beans using Dependency Injection (DI)
            4. Manages bean lifecycle (initialization, Initialisation, Destruction)
        Types of Spring Containers:
            Spring provides two main container types:
               1. BeanFactory
                1.1 Lightweight container
                1.2 Lazy initialization (beans are created only when needed)
                1.3 Suitable for simple applications
                Example:
                    BeanFactory factory = new XmlBeanFactory(new FileSystemResource("applicationContext.xml"));
                    Student s = (Student) factory.getBean("student");
               2. ApplicationContext (commonly used)
                2.1 More advanced and powerful
                2.2 Eager initialization (beans are created at startup)
                2.3 Supports internationalization, event propagation, AOP, etc.
                Example:
                    ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("applicationContext.xml");
                    Student s = (Student) context.getBean("student");
               How Spring Container works (in simple steps):
                   1. Spring Container reads configuration
                   2. It creates objects of the specified classes (like Student)
                   3. It injects values or dependencies using setters, constructors, or annotations
                   4. The beans are ready to use in your application

    4. Access Objects




NOTE : To use Spring we have to add some JAR files in our program. These JARs provide all the Spring classes and functionalities your application needs.
