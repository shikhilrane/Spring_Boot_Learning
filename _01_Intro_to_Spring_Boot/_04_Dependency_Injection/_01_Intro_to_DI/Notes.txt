Design Pattern :
    1. Design patterns are like pre-tested and proven blue print for solving common software problems
    2. They help developers write cleaner, more organized code by following established patterns for various tasks
    3. Examples :
        1. Singleton Pattern
        2. Factory Method Pattern
        3. DAO Design Pattern
        4. MVC Design Pattern

Dependency Injection ->

    1. Dependency Injection is a type of design pattern
    2. It is use to inject Dependency means one object into another object
    3. Example :
                                        Class 1                                               Class 2
                                    class Student{                                      class Address{
                                        private String name;                               private String city;
                                        private Address address;                           private int pincode;

                                        // getter setter                                   // getter and setter
                                    }                                                  }

                                ---------------------------                            ---------------------------
                                |                         |         Injecting          |                         |
                                |     Student's Object    |<------<-----<------<------<|    Address's Object     |
                                |                         |                            |                         |
                                ---------------------------                            ---------------------------

        Here, inject object of Address class injecting into object of Student class using configurations. (XML, Java, or Annotation)


Need of Dependency Injection ->
    1. If we didn't use DI then, we will hardcode everything and that will increase the dependency of classes on each other.
    2. Code Coupling
        1. Hard Code : means directly putting specific values (e.g.numbers or String) in your code rather than using variable or external variables. This an make code unreadable
        2. Tightly coupled : These classes have string dependency, where one class directly depends on another class
        3. Loosely coupled : These classes minimizes dependencies and make code more maintainable and flexible (BEST)
    3. DI is use to achieve loose coupling in Java

Achieving DI :
    There are 2 ways to achieve dependency injection
        1. Setter Method DI (Rarely used)
        2. Constructor DI (Widely used)
        3. Field Injection (Using @Autowired annotation) (Sometime useful)
