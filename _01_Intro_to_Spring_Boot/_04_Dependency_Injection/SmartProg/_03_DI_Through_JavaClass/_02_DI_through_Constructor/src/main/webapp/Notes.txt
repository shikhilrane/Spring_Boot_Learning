Step 1 -> Creation of beans
    1. Created beans package in java package
    2. Created a POJO class Student and defined properties name, rollNo and address
        where, name is String and rollNo is int
                but address is the class Address, whose properties will be injected in the Student's object
        and used constructor method, and passed all properties to the constructors
        Then created a display method, which will display the data on the screen
    3. Created a POJO class Address and defined properties houseNo, city and pincode
        and used constructor method, and passed all properties to the constructors
        and called toString method in it, it will provide values of properties to the next bean object

Step 2 -> Configuration
    1. Created a package config and created SpringConfigFile in it and used @Configuration annotation to it
    2. created a bean method for Student class and passed name for the bean from @Bean Annotation
        then pushed properties in it through constructor and just passed reference of createAddr() method to it
    3. Created a bean method for Address class and passed name for the bean from @Bean Annotation
        then pushed properties in it through constructor
    Now, we have provided configurations and now Spring container will handle the injection

Step 3 -> Spring Container
    1. Created a main package in java package and created MainClass in it
    2. in the MainClass, called ApplicationContext interface for AnnotationConfigApplicationContext class and passed SpringConfigFile.class file
    3. Created an object of student class and used getBeans() method for it and passed name of the Student bean class also typecasted it to Student bcoz it give output in Object.
    4. Called display method
